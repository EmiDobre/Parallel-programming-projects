# Parallel-programming-projects
In this repository I explored few of the concepts of parallel programming using the pthread library and java multithreading.
-This repository contains the Lab work for the "Parallel and Distributed Algorithms" course and also 2 more complex projects.
-The first project is implemented using pthread library in C and is a parallel implementation of the Marching Squares algorithm
that generates contours for a two-dimensional scalar field (rectangular array of individual numerical values).
-The second project uses Java Multithreading for implementing a dispatcher that manages the tasks that are going to be executed based on scheduling
policies.
